# SOP: Nightlife Editing Workflow

**Goal**: Speed + Vibe. We are not retouching skin for Vogue; we are selling the party.

## Pre-Requisites
*   Lightroom Classic or Mobile.
*   Preset Pack: `GettUpp_Night_V1` (Gold/Pink split toning, crushed blacks).

## Step-by-Step

### 1. Import & Cull (Time Limit: 15 mins)
*   Import all RAW files to `/RAW`.
*   **Pass 1 (Fast)**: Use 'P' to Pick.
    *   *Criteria*: Sharp focus on eyes (if portrait) or DJ (if wide). Good energy.
    *   *Reject*: Blurry, dark, awkward faces.
*   **Pass 2 (Refine)**: Filter by 'Picked'. Select top 10-20 for the "Pilot" delivery.

### 2. The "GettUpp" Edit (Time Limit: 1 min/photo)
*   **Apply Preset**: `GettUpp_Night_V1`.
*   **Exposure**: Bump up until faces are visible. Don't fear the noise.
*   **Highlights**: Pull down to save blown-out stage lights.
*   **Shadows**: Lift slightly, but keep blacks true black.
*   **Crop**:
    *   4:5 for IG Feed (Vertical).
    *   9:16 for Stories (Full Vertical).
    *   *Never* 16:9 Landscape unless it's a website hero.

### 3. Export
*   **Format**: JPEG, 85% Quality.
*   **Resolution**: Long edge 2160px (optimal for screens).
*   **Naming**: `[Venue]_[Date]_[Sequence].jpg` (e.g., `TheLoop_2025-11-24_001.jpg`).
*   **Destination**: `/03_EXPORTS`.

## Quality Check
*   [ ] Is the image sharp?
*   [ ] Is the horizon straight?
*   [ ] Does it look like a party I want to be at?
