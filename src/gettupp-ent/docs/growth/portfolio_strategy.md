# Portfolio Curation Strategy

## The Goal
Your portfolio isn't a gallery; it's a menu. It needs to show prospective clients exactly what they are buying.

## The "Menu" Structure (3 Core Dishes)

### 1. The "Vibe Check" (Crowd/Atmosphere)
*   **What it is**: Wide shots of packed rooms, hands in the air, confetti, CO2 cannons.
*   **Why it sells**: Promoters buy "busy". They want to look popular.
*   **Selection Criteria**:
    *   Must look FULL. No empty corners.
    *   Lighting must be dynamic (lasers, strobes).
    *   Motion blur is okay if it adds energy.

### 2. The "Product" (Bottles/Service)
*   **What it is**: Close-ups of bottle service presentations, sparklers, pouring drinks, beautiful garnishes.
*   **Why it sells**: Owners buy "revenue". High-margin items need to look expensive.
*   **Selection Criteria**:
    *   Sharp focus on the label/brand.
    *   Sparklers must be blown out (highlights preserved).
    *   Waitress/Staff looking professional/attractive.

### 3. The "Talent" (DJ/Performers)
*   **What it is**: Hero shots of the DJ, dancers, or performers.
*   **Why it sells**: Talent bookings drive traffic.
*   **Selection Criteria**:
    *   Low angle (make them look larger than life).
    *   Connection with the crowd (pointing, yelling, hands up).

## Curation Workflow

### Step 1: The "Selects" Folder
*   After every shoot, immediate cull.
*   Create a `Best_Of_[Month]` folder.
*   Copy the top 5 photos from that shoot into it.

### Step 2: The "Grid" Plan
*   Use a tool (or just a folder preview) to plan the IG grid.
*   **Pattern**: Wide (Crowd) -> Detail (Drink) -> Portrait (DJ) -> Wide (Crowd).
*   Never post two similar shots next to each other.

### Step 3: The Website Refresh
*   Update the landing page hero carousel once a month.
*   Keep it fresh. If a venue sees their photo on your site, they feel owned/loyal.

## Action Item
*   [ ] Gather 10 "Best Of" shots from previous work (or stock if bootstrapping) to populate the initial landing page.
