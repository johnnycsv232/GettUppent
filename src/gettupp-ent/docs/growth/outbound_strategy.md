# Outbound Targeting Strategy

## Objective
Identify and engage 50 qualified nightlife venues in Minneapolis/St. Paul per month to sell "Pilot Nights".

## Target Profile (ICP)
*   **Type**: Nightclubs, High-Volume Bars, Lounges, Event Centers.
*   **Geography**: Minneapolis (Downtown, North Loop, Uptown), St. Paul (West 7th, Lowertown).
*   **Signals**:
    *   Active on IG but low quality content (phone pics, dark/blurry).
    *   Inconsistent posting schedule (gaps of 3+ days).
    *   Promoting events with text-heavy flyers instead of video.
    *   "Grand Opening" or "Under New Management" tags.

## The "List Building" Agent (Manual + AI)
Since we cannot fully automate IG scraping safely, we use a hybrid approach.

### Step 1: Source (The "Feed Sweep")
*   **Action**: Founder spends 15 mins/day on IG.
*   **Search**: #MplsNightlife, #MplsBar, #MinneapolisEvents.
*   **Identify**: Venues that match ICP.
*   **Capture**: Add to `leads.json` (or Google Sheet).

### Step 2: Enrichment (The "Deep Dive")
*   **Agent Task**: Research the venue.
*   **Data Points**:
    *   Owner/GM Name (LinkedIn/Website).
    *   Busiest Night (look at tagged photos).
    *   Current Content Vibe (Rating 1-10).

## Outreach Cadence (The "3-Touch Combo")

### Touch 1: The "Soft Open" (IG DM)
*   **Goal**: Get a read receipt and a "sure".
*   **Context**: Reply to a Story or recent post. Don't cold DM out of nowhere if possible.

### Touch 2: The "Value Drop" (Email/DM)
*   **Goal**: Show, don't tell.
*   **Content**: Send a mock-up or a specific compliment + critique. "I saw your Friday post. The energy was there, but the lighting killed it. Here's how we'd shoot it."

### Touch 3: The "Pilot Offer" (Closer)
*   **Goal**: Book the $345 Pilot.
*   **Offer**: "One night. No contract. If you hate the photos, you don't pay."

## KPIs
*   **Volume**: 10 New Leads / Week.
*   **Conversion**: 2 Pilots / Week.
*   **CAC**: $0 (Organic/Manual).
