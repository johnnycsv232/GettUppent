# DM Script Library

## Principles
*   **No "Hey hun"**: Be professional, direct, and masculine/neutral.
*   **No Walls of Text**: 2-3 sentences max.
*   **Context is King**: Reference something specific (their DJ, their renovation, their last weekend).

## Scripts

### 1. The "Story Reply" (Low Friction)
*Use this when they post a Story of a packed night.*

> "Crowd looks insane tonight. 🔥 Need to capture that energy better though—it's too dark to see the scale. We should shoot a Pilot Night for you guys."

### 2. The "Specific Compliment" (Cold DM)
*Use this for venues with good design but bad content.*

> "Hey [Name/Team], love the new renovation at [Venue]. The lighting setup is top tier.
> 
> I noticed your feed isn't doing the space justice yet. We run a content engine specifically for Mpls nightlife. We shoot, edit, and deliver in 24h.
> 
> Open to a test run next Friday?"

### 3. The "Flyer Fix" (Response to Event Flyer)
*Use this when they post a graphic flyer.*

> "Flyer looks good. But video sells tables.
> 
> Let us come shoot a 15s reel for the next event. We'll turn this flyer into actual FOMO. $345 flat fee to test us out."

### 4. The "Follow Up" (Bump)
*Use 48h after no response.*

> "Bumping this. We have one slot left for this Friday. Want us to swing by?"

## Objection Handling

**"We have a guy."**
> "Cool. Is he delivering next-day? We're not trying to replace him, we're an engine for volume. Use us for the nights he can't make, or for fast-turnaround reels."

**"Too expensive."**
> "It's $345. That's two bottle service tabs. One good reel pays for itself in cover charge alone."

**"Send me a PDF."**
> "Happy to. Check [gettupp.com](#) for the full breakdown. But honestly, the best proof is the Pilot. Let's just do one night."
