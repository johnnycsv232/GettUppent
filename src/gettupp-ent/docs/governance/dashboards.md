# Governance: The Weekly Scorecard

## Overview
As a solo founder, you don't need complex analytics. You need a pulse check.
Review this scorecard every **Monday Morning**.

## The "Big 3" Metrics

### 1. Pipeline Volume (Leads)
*   **Metric**: New "Pilot" Inquiries.
*   **Target**: 2 per week.
*   **Source**: `leads.json` (count "new" status).

### 2. Production Velocity (Shoots)
*   **Metric**: Shoots Completed.
*   **Target**: 1 per week (Month 1), 3 per week (Month 3).
*   **Source**: `shoot_log.json` (count "completed").

### 3. Cash Flow (Revenue)
*   **Metric**: Cash Collected (not just invoiced).
*   **Target**: $1,500 / month (MVB Breakeven).
*   **Source**: Bank Account / Venmo.

## The "Quality" Check (Subjective)
*   **Client Happiness**: Did anyone complain? (Y/N)
*   **Portfolio Growth**: Did we get at least one "Banger" shot this week? (Y/N)

## Monthly Review Routine
1.  **Update Portfolio**: Move "Best Of" shots to the landing page.
2.  **Prune Leads**: Mark unresponsive leads as "dead" in `leads.json`.
3.  **Check Pricing**: If you are booked 100% of the time, raise prices by 20%.
