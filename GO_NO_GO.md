# GO/NO-GO DECISION: GETTUPPENT LAUNCH

**Date:** 2025-11-26
**Recommendation:** 🛑 **NO-GO**

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
While the frontend and lead capture systems are operational, the business cannot currently function because **revenue collection and service fulfillment mechanisms are missing**. Launching now would create a backlog of leads that cannot be processed, invoiced, or serviced efficiently, likely damaging the brand reputation.

## CRITICAL BLOCKERS (MUST FIX BEFORE LAUNCH)
1.  **No Payment Processing:** You cannot collect the $345 pilot fee.
2.  **No Client Records:** Leads cannot be converted into Clients.
3.  **No Shoot Management:** You cannot schedule or track the shoots you sell.
4.  **No Delivery System:** You cannot deliver the final photos/videos to clients.

## THE PATH TO "GO" (MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT)
To change this to a **GO**, we must complete **Week 1** of the Roadmap:
1.  Integrate Stripe.
2.  Create "Client" database records.
3.  Build a simple "Convert Lead to Client" button.
4.  Generate an automated Invoice.

**Estimated Time to Fix:** 1 Week (approx. 20-30 hours of dev work).

## VERDICT
**Do not launch today.** Focus purely on the **Revenue Engine** (Stripe + Client DB) for the next 5-7 days. Once you can take money, you can launch.
