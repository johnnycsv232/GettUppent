**[7:15 PM] You:** Look, I saw what I saw on Saturday. You had your hands on the bars throwing it back with a smile on your face. That wasn’t an accident or someone catching you off guard - you were enjoying it. And that’s the reality I have to deal with. Here’s the bigger picture: we’ve been doing this for a year, and I’ve never asked you to be official. Maybe that’s on me. But even without a title, I thought there was respect and intention here. If I’m wrong about that, I need to know. So here’s what I’m asking: do you actually want something real with me - consistency, exclusivity, making time for each other that matters? Because if you do, we need to start fresh and be clear about what we are. If you’re not ready for that or you don’t want it, then we’re done and I’ll move on Because I have to to protect myself
**[7:52 PM] Cristina:** I would be open to that
**[8:21 PM] You:** Okay. I appreciate you being open to it.

If we’re doing this, here’s what I need to be clear about from the start:

We’re exclusive. That means we’re each other’s person - no dancing with other people, no situations that cross lines, no wondering where we stand.

We make real time for each other. Dinner, The Simpsons, just us. Not leftovers of your schedule, but actual plans that matter.

We communicate honestly. If something’s wrong, we talk about it. If you’re not feeling it anymore, you tell me. No games.

I’m all in if you are. But I need to see the effort match the words. Actions over promises.

Let’s start fresh right now. First step: come over, we’ll order food and watch The Simpsons. Just us. Pick a day that works for you.
**[8:53 PM] Cristina:** I could probably do tomorrow
**[8:53 PM] You:** Okay Perfect. Tomorrow works. What time is good for you?
